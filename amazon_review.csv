0,Pavan H,I would not recommend this product for winters.

2,D. Kong,"This pair of gloves is not for very cold temperatures, but is of high quality build and should be able to handle most East Coast urban winter environments and outdoor activities.  If you need to use it for 20 F or lower temperatures with high wind chill factor, then you either need to use it with a pair of glove-sleeves/inner gloves or get a pair of heavier gloves. The stitching and seams are well executed.  The profile is slim and they do not feel bulky on my hands.  I can wear them with business and causal wears.  Index fingers on both gloves can operate smart phones and tablets.  Also, there is a micro fastex style buckle that can clip both gloves together. I highly recommend this pair of gloves."
3,Alexey,"They look good, and great quality. The touch screen tips work but not well. They do not keep your hands and fingers warm at very cold weather! I will have to find another gloves for cold weather. For example - Columbia Men's Northport Insulated Softshell Glove.I will add a little.I am not happy with the condition of my hands (fingers) in cold weather with these gloves. At 0 degrees Celsius, you can still just walk in them. But as soon as the temperature drops to at least -5 degrees Celsius, your fingers just freeze. In order for these gloves to be comfortable, you need to constantly actively do something. Otherwise, it will simply not work to warm your hands (fingers).It is a pity that these gloves cannot warm my hands (fingers) at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius during normal walking use."
4,Charl,"I normally wear size L and this size L fits very well. There is enough room on the palm and back of hands so that it doesn't restrict movement. It is comfortable when holding trekking poles or driving wheel without too much pressure on knuckle area. The fit on fingers are perfect for me, except that the thumbs are 1cm too long. My thumbs can only reach the end of gloves when I do a thumb up gesture. I don't think my activity involves the thumb up gesture at all. A walk outside at 4C temperature initially feels a bit cold on hands. After a while the blood circulation is more active my hands feel warm. Overall I like the gloves very much."
5,Robert,"I took the advice of all the reviews and ordered a size up from normal. Big mistake, these gloves for me like any other gloves this style i have bought. The gloves i ordered in large are baggy on my finger tips and i should have went with my normal medium size order. The gloves themselves are awesome and are great quality. The touch screen tips work as they say."
6,RBostillo,"They look good, fit snug and the touch screen fingers actually work. They seem well put together. They do not keep your hands and fingers warm once about 40deg out or lower! I will have to find another option for those cooler nights."
